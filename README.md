# Euclidean-constructions
The formalisation of Euclidean constructions in Lean 4. In this programme, I formalise the proof that the natural numbers are all constructable under ruler and compass constructions. 

This was the code that I evaluated and gave a tutorial on for my third-year dissertation. I achieved a grade of 75%.

Feedback given by Dr. Francois Dupressoir: 
"A nice-to-read document, providing a nice introduction to not just interactive theorem proving, but the understanding and intuition work that needs to be carried out before a formalisation task can be properly carried out. A few simple presentational and technical improvements would likely make it acceptable for publication either as a Proof Pearl in an interactive theorem proving conference. Completing the work as planned would likely bring the work to the standard of a contribution in a specialist journal.

After a nice high-level overview of the problem and an introduction to the project's objectives, the dissertation starts with a very pleasant and highly accessible chapter, turning the geometric intuition into algebraic problems with computational solutions. Oscar then states his main result, and gives an intuitive proof, and an intuitive explanation for the formalisation strategy. This is followed by more exposition (of dependent type theory, then Lean's approach to it, and then more precise concepts and properties of importance to the formalisation effort), which is then explicitly and critically related back to the project's objectives, but also stands as valuable on its own right.

.....the amount of learning and experience gained demonstrated by the coherent write-up is already quite a bit beyond expectations of a 20CP project."
